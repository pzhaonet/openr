      <description>I have collected plenty of equations in my research in recent years. Most of them were typed by my own hands. For convenience, I organized them in an ASCII file named eq.tex as an equation library, side by side with a compiled file named eq.pdf. When I needed an equation, I searched eq.pdf, and looked for the codes in eq.tex, and then copied and posted it to my working document.</description>
