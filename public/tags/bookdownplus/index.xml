      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I collected some LaTeX templates when learning LaTeX. However, my interest in LaTeX was gone after submitting my PhD dissertation. I should have deleted these templates if they had not been so small. They would never be useful in the future, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I started writing the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://xuer.pzhao.org&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Learning R: R for Rookies&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;. Unexpectedly, MS Word could not satisfy me with the typesetting. You know what I mean if you have experience (and pain) in writing a long book or dissertation with Word. Actually I suffered more, but I do not want to talk about it. I was sure that LaTeX could, but I would rather not use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a bolt out of the blue, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown&#34;&gt;bookdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
