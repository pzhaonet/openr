      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the funniest things I found when I (as a Windows user) leant Ubuntu  was that there is a command &lt;code&gt;fortune&lt;/code&gt;, which prints a random/pseudorandom message from a database of quotations. It is said that this old feature has been available since 1970s. It was a pity that this feature was unavailable in boring Windows OS, until the R community developed in 2012 a package called &#39;fortunes,&#39;  which displays funny messages taken from the talks or communications in the R community. It supports external database as well. Unfortunately, it does not support Chinese texts, probably because (1) the &#39;fortunes&#39; package cannot read multibyte characters such as Chinese, and (2) no one contributes Chinese database of fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a great loss, as fortunes actually come from Chinese restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
