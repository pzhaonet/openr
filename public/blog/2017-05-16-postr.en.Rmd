This is a preliminary version of the introduction to postr. Please go to my Github repo [postr](https://github.com/pzhaonet/postr) for the latest updates.

This package is modified from [kuleuven-template](https://github.com/exporl/kuleuven-templates), where you can see the requirements before using this package. Here I picked out the instruction for Windows users as follows.

- Install a LaTeX distribution, e.g. [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download). For Chinese users [CTeX](http://www.ctex.org/CTeXDownload) is highly recommended.
- Install [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html)
- Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- Install [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- Install [Python filter support for Pandoc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandocfilters):
  on a Windows command prompt, type `pip install pandocfilters`
- Install [SumatraPDF](http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/download-free-pdf-viewer.html) for auto-refresh of PDF previews

Afterwards, add the Python directory to the system PATH variable.

## Quick start

Run the following codes, and you will get some files (e.g. `poster.Rmd`) and folders in your working directory.

```
devtools::install_github("pzhaonet/postr")
getwd() # this is your working directory. run setwd() to change it.
postr::postr()
```

Now open `poster.Rmd` in RStudio, and press `ctrl+shift+k` to compile it. You will get a file named `poster.pdf` in your working directory. Open it with any pdf viewer (SumatraPDF, Adebe Reader, whatever).

If the bibliography section is not displayed in the poster, knitr `poster.Rmd` once more.

A lot of annoying files and folders produced? You can remove them by running (Caution! You won't find them in your recycle bin!):

```
postr::postr_del()
```

Have fun!

Still being developed.  Feel free to give your feedback to me!
