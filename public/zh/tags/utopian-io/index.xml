      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I collected some LaTeX templates when learning LaTeX. However, my interest in LaTeX was gone after submitting my PhD dissertation. I should have deleted these templates if they had not been so small. They would never be useful in the future, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I started writing the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://xuer.pzhao.org&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Learning R: R for Rookies&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;. Unexpectedly, MS Word could not satisfy me with the typesetting. You know what I mean if you have experience (and pain) in writing a long book or dissertation with Word. Actually I suffered more, but I do not want to talk about it. I was sure that LaTeX could, but I would rather not use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a bolt out of the blue, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown&#34;&gt;bookdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[New Project] advr: an R package for the scientific research on trace gas advection flux density</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide (CO~2~) is one of the key green house gases which play an important role in the global climate change. In academia, the sources and sinks of CO~2~ are estimated with the flux density, e.g. the amount of CO~2~ passing through a unit area in a unit time. Estimates of net ecosystem CO~2~ exchange have been attracting a lot of attention. The research on the advection flux takes care of the contribution of the advection term to the CO~2~ balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I built two mirror sites for my steem posts (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dapeng.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;mirror 1&lt;/a&gt;，&lt;a href=&#34;https://steemit.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;mirror 2&lt;/a&gt;) as backups, which are synced automatically everyday, thanks to steemsql and steemdata. The mirror sites are very useful:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
